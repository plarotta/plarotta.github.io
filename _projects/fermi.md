## Intro
As part of the GEM fellowship program, students are matched with employers which in return for tuition sponsorship of the student's graduate program expect students to complete summer internships until graduation. I matched to [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/) and as part of my fellowship program got the opportunity to complete two summer internships at Fermi. Fermi is America's premier particle physics research lab which for a while housed the world's largest, most powerful particle accelerator. While that title goes to CERN now, Fermi is still at the forefront of particle physics research, now focusing on dark matter, dark energy, and stress-testing the standard model of physics.

I am by no means anything close to a particle physicist, but as an early career engineer I never back away from an opportunity to learn. Fermi drew me because the level of engineering required to execute a lot of their experiments is incredible. During my time at Fermi I was exposed to two central focuses of the lab: radiofrequency cavity assembly, and the mu2e experiment. I was incredibly lucky to have these two experiences because they exposed me to areas at opposite ends of the science stack of Fermi. 

## Superconductive Radio-frequency Cavities (SRF)
In my first summer I was an intern under the Applied Physics and Superconducting Technology Division [APS-TD](https://td.fnal.gov/) which focuses on the research and development of superconductive magnets and cavities for general purpose applications. Work from this division has impact across the lab and as well as the broader particle physics community. 

Radio-frequency cavities are essential for high-energy physics because they are source of acceleration for particles passing through the accelerator complex.
