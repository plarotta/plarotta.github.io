# Objective question:
Is it possible to measure the density of a fluid through the dynamics of its container?

# Abstract
Using sound to assay liquid solutions is a powerful technique because of its potential as a
fast, non-invasive method for physical analysis. In this work we explore the potential of using
singing wine glasses to measure the density of a solution by fitting a model describing the relationship between density and frequency and comparing the model predictions to experimental data. We conclude that the model explains the relationship between liquid height and the frequency of the sound response, but it does not accurately describe the relationship between liquid density and frequency. Without a direct relationship between density and frequency, we cannot extract density from the sound response of a singing wine glass.
