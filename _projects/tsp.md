This project captures some of the main takeaways from the first unit of Columbia's class on Evolutionary Computation. I also show how genetic algorithms can be used as gradient-free optimization methods by developing a simple implementation to solve the Traveling Salesperson problem. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/plarotta/genetic-traveling-salesperson).
