This project captures a learning exploration into the fundamentals of deep learning. In this project I build and train neural networks from scratch using Numpy, and I validate my approach by comparing it to PyTorch-trained models. Repo can be found [here](https://github.com/plarotta/NumpyNet).

## Problem description
Neural networks are function approximators comprised of compositions of linear operators and non-linear activation functions. At their core, neural networks combine many ```y=wx+b``` operations to minimize the prediction error of the entire neural network on the training data. 

In this project I set out to become familiar with the under-the-hood of multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) by implmented methods for creating, training, and testing neural networks with Numpy alone. 

## My contributions
- Class definitions used for creating models in object-oriented Python
- Full implementations of feedforward and backpropagation operations
- Performance speedup with just-in-time compilation through Numba
