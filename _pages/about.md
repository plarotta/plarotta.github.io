Hi! I'm Pedro, I am from Bogota, Colombia, and I'm a Master's student at Columbia working at the intersection of Robotics and ML 🤖. My undergrad was in Mechanical Engineering from MIT where I specialized in biomedical devices and biomechanics. My main interest is developing robots that can better aid humans.

In my free time, I like to escape the concrete jungle to hike, run, and go to live music shows with friends. I am an avid networker so if you find yourself in the city and are open to grabbing a coffee, feel free to connect with me over email or linkedin!
