Hi! I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at Columbia working on machine learning for robotic control. My undergrad was in Mechanical Engineering from MIT where I specialized in medical devices. Ultimately, my goal is to develop robots that improve human life.

In my free time, I like to escape the concrete jungle to hike, run, and go to live music shows with friends. I am an avid networker so if you find yourself in the city and are open to grabbing a coffee, please shoot me an email!
