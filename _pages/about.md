Hi! I'm Pedro, I am from **Bogota, Colombia**, and I am currently a **Master's** student at **Columbia University** working at the intersection of Robotics and ML ðŸ¤–. I work in the [Robotic Manipulation and Mobility (ROAM) Lab](https://roam.me.columbia.edu/) as a research assistant advised by [Matei Ciocarlie](https://roam.me.columbia.edu/people/matei-ciocarlie). I am a GEM fellow sponsored by [Fermi National Accelerator Lab](https://www.fnal.gov/).

I am a robotics engineer excited by all things hardware and software, and my research interests are primarily in medical robotics and robot learning.

In my free time, I like to escape the concrete jungle to hike, run, and go to live music shows with friends. Let's connect over email or linkedin!
